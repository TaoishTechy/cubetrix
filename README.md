## 🌌 Overview

CubeTrix is an open-source research framework for simulating and analyzing artificial general intelligence (AGI) in hyper-dimensional manifolds. By integrating rigorous mathematical foundations from quantum mechanics, differential geometry, and information theory, CubeTrix provides a physics-grounded platform for studying consciousness proxies, emergent intelligence, and topological phase transitions in complex systems.

**Core Philosophy**: Intelligence and consciousness emerge from the interplay between information integration, topological complexity, and quantum coherence across multiple scales.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Quantum State Evolution** with topological perturbations
- **Discrete Ricci Curvature** analysis on graph manifolds
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT 3.0)** Φ-calculations
- **Topological Charge** detection (Skyrmions, Chern numbers)
- **Multifractal Analysis** of state space trajectories
- **Lyapunov Exponent** estimation for chaos detection
- **Hyperbolic Embedding** of consciousness metrics
- **Unified Diagnostics** matrix for AGI phase detection
