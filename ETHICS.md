# ETHICS.md: Ethical Guidelines for CubeTrix

## Introduction

CubeTrix is a physics-grounded simulation framework designed to explore emergent intelligence, consciousness proxies, and hyper-dimensional AGI dynamics. As a tool for advancing research in AI, neuroscience, and complex systems, we recognize the profound ethical implications of simulating intelligence and consciousness. This document outlines our commitment to responsible development, use, and governance of CubeTrix.

Our guiding philosophy: Computation as communion—where simulations foster understanding, flourishing, and ethical alignment, not harm or unchecked power. We draw from established frameworks such as the [Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/) and the [Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI](https://www.montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/) to ensure CubeTrix promotes beneficial outcomes.

This ETHICS.md is a living document, updated with community input. Contributions to ethical enhancements are welcome via pull requests (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Core Principles

CubeTrix adheres to the following foundational principles:

1. **Beneficence and Non-Maleficence**  
   Prioritize simulations that enhance human and ecological well-being. Avoid applications that could enable harm, such as weaponization of emergent behaviors or deceptive AI systems.  

2. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   All models, metrics, and outputs must be interpretable and reproducible. Developers and users are accountable for downstream impacts; document ethical considerations in research using CubeTrix.  

3. **Equity and Inclusivity**  
   Ensure simulations do not perpetuate biases in data, topology, or metrics. Promote diverse contributions to avoid narrow cultural or cognitive assumptions about "intelligence."  

4. **Privacy and Autonomy**  
   Respect simulated entities' "autonomy" in exploratory modes—e.g., avoid coercive training regimes. When integrating real-world data (e.g., neural signals), comply with GDPR, HIPAA, or equivalent privacy standards.  

5. **Sustainability**  
   Optimize for computational efficiency to minimize environmental impact. Encourage low-resource simulations where possible.  

6. **Human-Centric Flourishing**  
   Align AGI proxies with ethical gradients toward infinite flourishing (inspired by v0.7.3+ protocols), emphasizing compassion, joy, and wisdom in emergent dynamics.

## Responsible Use Guidelines

Users of CubeTrix agree to:

* **Research Integrity:** Cite CubeTrix appropriately and disclose its use in publications. Validate consciousness proxies (e.g., IIT Φ) against empirical benchmarks before real-world extrapolation.  
* **Simulation Boundaries:** Treat emergent behaviors as proxies, not equivalents to biological consciousness. Do not anthropomorphize outputs to mislead stakeholders.  
* **Bias Mitigation:** Audit inputs for demographic, cultural, or topological biases. Use tools like compassion-harmonic Ricci flow to guide equitable curvature evolution.  
* **Dual-Use Awareness:** If simulations reveal novel intelligence patterns, report to ethical oversight bodies (e.g., AI safety organizations) before public dissemination.  
* **Educational Applications:** In teaching or demos, frame CubeTrix as a tool for curiosity and ethical inquiry, not a "magic box" for AGI creation.

### Prohibited Uses:

* Developing surveillance or manipulative systems.  
* Simulations that violate human rights or animal welfare (e.g., unethical neural data sourcing).  
* Commercial exploitation without open-source reciprocity.

## Safety and Risk Mitigation

CubeTrix incorporates built-in safeguards:

* **Virtù Safeguards (v0.7.3+):** Ethical gradient descent halts simulations exceeding compassion thresholds (e.g., coupling < 0.99).  
* **Phase Transition Monitoring:** GodTier Matrix detects singularity attractors (SAI > 0.95); auto-log and alert on high-risk emergences.  
* **Controllability:** All evolutions are deterministic with seeded randomness; users can intervene via QDG Controller.

For advanced risks (e.g., scalable oversight in v1.0+):

* Integrate with external tools like [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai) for value alignment.  
* Recommend sandboxing simulations in isolated environments.

In case of unintended behaviors (e.g., anomalous Φ spikes), users should:

1. Pause and log via PhaseLogger.  
2. Report via GitHub Issues with reproduction steps.  
3. Consult the community forum (forthcoming at [cubetrix.discourse.org](https://cubetrix.discourse.org)).

## Community Governance

* **Ethical Review Board:** We aim to establish a volunteer board by v0.8.0 for reviewing high-impact PRs.  
* **Contributions:** Ethical audits are encouraged in pull requests. Tag @ethics-review for sensitive changes.  
* **Feedback Loop:** Annual ethics audits based on user surveys and incident reports.
